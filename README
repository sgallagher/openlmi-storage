About
=====

OpenLMI-Storage is CIM provider for storage management on Linux.
Currently it has SMI-S like API, Block Devices Package is paritally
implemented. See Documentation below for details.

The provider is written in Python and based on Anaconda installer storage
module. Therefore it is probably usable only on Red Hat based distros,
like Fedora.
