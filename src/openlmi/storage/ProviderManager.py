class ProviderManager(object):
    """
        Simple class containing references to various providers to simplify
        various tasks.
        
        The manager holds reference to all device providers of Anaconda
        StorageDevice subclasses and all LMI_*Setting providers.        
        The manager can then find a CIM provider for a
        StorageDevice instance and find provider or StorageDevice instance
        for CIM InstanceName.
        The major benefit of this manager is to convert Anaconda StorageDevice
        instance to CIM InstanceName and back. Therefore various associations
        can easily get their Antecendent/Dependent InstanceNames.

        The device providers must be registered by add_device_provider().
        The device providers must be subclasses of DeviceProvider class.
        
        The manager holds references to LMI_*Setting providers. For example
        LMI_*Service providers need access to settings, so they can use this
        manager to get them.
        The setting providers must be registered by add_setting_provider().
        The setting providers must be subclasses of SettingProvider class.
        
        The manager holds references to LMI_*Service providers, so
        the LMI_HostedService can easily enumerate all services.
        The service providers must be registered by add_service_provider().
        The service providers must be subclasses of ServiceProvider class.
