            Implementation of basic associations. This method can be used by
            all subclasses, which implement association provider.
            
            It has the same arguments as references() method of CIMProvider2,
            additional 'first_class' and 'second_class' should contain
            string with CIM class names of the associated classes.

            All four association-related operations (Associators, AssociatorNames,
            References, ReferenceNames) are mapped to this method.
            This method is a python generator

            Keyword arguments:
            env -- Provider Environment (pycimmb.ProviderEnvironment)
            object_name -- A pywbem.CIMInstanceName that defines the source
                CIM Object whose associated Objects are to be returned.
            model -- A template pywbem.CIMInstance to serve as a model
                of the objects to be returned.  Only properties present on this
                model need to be set.
            result_class_name -- If not empty, this string acts as a filter on
                the returned set of Instances by mandating that each returned
                Instances MUST represent an association between object_name
                and an Instance of a Class whose name matches this parameter
                or a subclass.
            role -- If not empty, MUST be a valid Property name. It acts as a
                filter on the returned set of Instances by mandating that each
                returned Instance MUST refer to object_name via a Property
                whose name matches the value of this parameter.
            result_role -- If not empty, MUST be a valid Property name. It acts
                as a filter on the returned set of Instances by mandating that
                each returned Instance MUST represent associations of
                object_name to other Instances, where the other Instances play
                the specified result_role in the association (i.e. the
                name of the Property in the Association Class that refers to
                the Object related to object_name MUST match the value of this
                parameter).
            keys_only -- A boolean.  True if only the key properties should be
                set on the generated instances.
    
            The following diagram may be helpful in understanding the role,
            result_role, and result_class_name parameters.
