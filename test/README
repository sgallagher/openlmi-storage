OpenLMI-Storage test suite
==========================

This directory contains various test of OpenLMI-Storage.
Standard Python unittest framework is used to run the tests.

Unittests
---------
Unit tests, i.e. tests which simulate the surrounding, are located in
'test/unittest' directory. These test can be run anywhere.

System tests
------------
Tests directly in 'test' directory communicate with a CIMOM and tests CIMOM and
OpenLMI-Storage provider registered to it.

Usage
^^^^^
Just install openlmi-storage as usual and start your CIMOM.

The tests must run on the same machine as the CIMOM!

Set following environment variables:
LMI_CIMOM_URL - URL to the CIMOM, e.g. 'https://localhost:5989'.
LMI_CIMOM_USERNAME - Name of the user on CIMOM the test will use, e.g. 'root'.
LMI_CIMOM_PASSWORD - Password of the user, e.g. 'opensesame'.
LMI_STORAGE_DISK - Disks available for testing. The disks must be empty, i.e.
                   there must be no partitions on it. The first disk must have
                   at least one gigabyte of space.
                   The tests will partition the disk, add it to RAID,
                   format the disks etc. Do not use system disk in this
                   variable!
                   For example: '/dev/sda'.
LMI_STORAGE_PARTITIONS - Space-separated list of partitions or other block
                         devices, which will be used for testing. The partitions
                         must be empty and must have the same size.
                         The tests will destroy all data on these partitions,
                         do not use the system ones!
                         At lest 10 partitions must be provided!
                         For example: LMI_STORAGE_PARTITIONS=/dev/sdb?*
LMI_CIMOM_BROKER - Name of the CIMOM service, e.g. 'tog-pegasus'. Several tests
                   need to restart the CIMOM and they will invoke.
                   'service $LMI_CIMOM_BROKER restart'.

These environment variables are optional:
LMI_STORAGE_CLEAN - If a test fails and the test created some storage devices,
                    the test suite will automatically clean all these new
                    devices, so other tests can continue with clean system.
                    If this variable is set to empty string, the test suite
                    will not clean the devices, so the user can examine created
                    devices and see, why the test failed.
LMI_STORAGE_VERBOSE - If this variable is set to nonempty value, the test suite
                      will print extra debugging information, for example
                      all udev events.

Running single test:
    LMI_CIMOM_PASSWORD=opensesame \
    LMI_STORAGE_DISK="/dev/sda" \
    LMI_STORAGE_PARTITIONS=/dev/sdb?* \
    LMI_CIMOM_BROKER="tog-pegasus" \
    python test/test_create_mdraid.py

Running all tests:
    LMI_CIMOM_PASSWORD=opensesame \
    LMI_STORAGE_DISK="/dev/sda" \
    LMI_STORAGE_PARTITIONS=/dev/sdb?* \
    LMI_CIMOM_BROKER="tog-pegasus" \
    python -m unittest discover -s test/

Beware, all tests can take lot of time! Lot of partitions/RAIDs/volume groups
are created and deleted!


Code coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To calculate test coverage during tests, install python coverage module
and use coverage_wrapper.py instead of cimom_entry.py when registering the
providers:

sed <LMI_Storage.reg > /tmp/LMI_Storage.reg -e 's/cimom_entry/coverage_wrapper/g'

Register the new LMI_Storage.reg to your CIMOM and start the tests. Coverage
statistics are saved always to new file in /var/lib/openlmi-storage/coverage
directory, i.e. you tests can safely restart the CIMOM without loosing the
coverage.

To export HTML report, use:
COVERAGE_FILE=/var/lib/openlmi-storage/coverage/coverage coverage combine
COVERAGE_FILE=/var/lib/openlmi-storage/coverage/coverage coverage html -d report/

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
To create new test, just subclass StorageTestBase, which has useful
setUp / tearDown methods to monitor created devices and remove them when the
test fails. All test start with empty disk, i.e. there is no partition on the
LMI_STORAGE_DISK and no data on LMI_STORAGE_PARTITIONS. The test must clean
all devices (including partitions) it creates.
