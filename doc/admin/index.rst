OpenLMI Storage Provider documentation
======================================

OpenLMI-Storage is CIM provider which manages local block devices, i.e. block
devices which are present in ``/dev/`` directory. This includes also attached
iSCSI, FC and FCoE devices, as long as appropriate block device is present.

Application developers who are familiar with SMI-S should start read at
:ref:`SMI-S profiles <smis-profiles>` chapter.

Application developers and/or sysadmins should skip whole SMI-S and start
reading :ref:`OpenLMI-Storage usage <openlmi-usage>`.
